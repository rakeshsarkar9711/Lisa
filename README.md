## :heavy_check_mark: Tecnologies Used

Front-end (on netlify.com):

- `React`
- `Next.js`
- `TypeScript`
- `Axios`
- `Firebase`
- `GraphQL`
- `Framer Motion`
- `Swiper`
- `Anilist API`
- `Consumet API`
- `Aniwatch API`

Back-End:

- `Firebase`
- `Next.js API Routes`

## :computer: How Can I Run It?

1. `Fork` (recommended) or `Clone` this repository

```javascript
  git clone https://github.com/ErickLimaS/anime-website.git
```

2. Run `npm install` on your CMD to get all dependencies

```javascript
npm install
```

3. Now you will need to create a `.env.local` file on the `project root folder` with the url to where your Consumet and Aniwatch is setted and the settings to your Firebase Account.

   - Go to these repos and host your own instance:
     - <a href='https://github.com/consumet/api.consumet.org'>Consumet API</a>
     - <a href='https://github.com/ghoshRitesh12/aniwatch-api'>Aniwatch API</a>
   - OPTIONAL: This project uses a JSON file (47 mb) filled with Animes and Mangas data as a offline Database. This repository already has this file, but it might be outdated, so you decide if you want to ignore this step.
     - Go to <a href='https://github.com/manami-project/anime-offline-database'>anime-offline-database</a> and download the JSON file that will be used on only `Search Page` (or you can make some changes and use some API to fetch the data).
     - With the file downloaded, put it in the `/app/api/anime-info` directory, replacing the previous one.
   - On Firebase, get your configs to use the Authentication and Firestore Database.
     - All the Firebase info needed bellow can be found when you create a new project.
     - IMPORTANT: Make Sure to ALLOW your Hosted Website Domain on Firebase Authentication!

With all that done, you will need to fill the `.env.local` like the example bellow:

```javascript
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONSUMET_API_URL=https://your-hosted-consumet-api-url.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANIWATCH_API_URL=https://your-hosted-aniwatch-api-url.com
// Make sure to add the pathname "/api/animes-database" bellow
NEXT_PUBLIC_NEXT_INTERNAL_API_URL=https://url-to-where-your-website-is-hosted.com/api/animes-database
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=firebase-setting-related-to-this-field
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=firebase-setting-related-to-this-field
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=firebase-setting-related-to-this-field
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=firebase-setting-related-to-this-field
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER=firebase-setting-related-to-this-field
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=firebase-setting-related-to-this-field
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=firebase-setting-related-to-this-field
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=firebase-setting-related-to-this-field
```

4. Now run `npm run dev` to initialize the website

```javascript
npm run dev
```

5. That's it! It should be running.

## :open_file_folder: How Firebase is Organized

### Authentication

With Firebase Authentication, theres 4 methods of Login/Signup:

- Email
- Google
- GitHub
- Anonymous

It is used to store on User Document things like:

- User Profile Photo
- Username
- Preferences (media source, adult content, subtitles and more)
- Comments
- Notifications
- Bookmarked Medias
- Currently Watching Medias
- Episodes Watched/Chapters Read

### Collections and Documents

With Firebase Database, we have 3 Collections:

#### Users

Stores only Users Documents after a successfull signup.

#### Comments

Stores comments made on episodes or on its main page.

Its separated based on Anilist API Media IDs Documents, and after that, a Collection that holds all comments to this media and other related to a episode where that comment was made.

It strongly depends on Users Collection, due to each comment needs its user (owner). Each comment has a referer to its owner and stores its interactions, with Likes and Dislikes.

When a Comment is made, it saves sort of a log on User Document, with infos like interactions with other comment or written on a episode.

#### Notifications

The Notifications Collections stores a document for each Media ID related to Anilist API every time a user assigned himself to be notified about a new episode release.

Each document has a Collection that holds every user assigned to receive a notification.

In this document, has info of all episodes already notified to any user and the next to be notified, cover art, if is complete, status and last update date.

- User Document Relation: After a successfull notification is deliveried to user, it stores the last episode info on User Document, so it can be notified again and the next one is released.
